by [Gregor Boehl](https://gregorboehl.com).

This course is a generic introduction to (scientific) programming in economics, covering the essentials: 

    * variables
    * conditionals
    * loops
    * functions
    * scientific programming (with `numpy`)
    * plotting
    * basics of data analysis (with `pandas`)
    * some perspectives (performance, parallelization, ...)

The examples cover Python code.
