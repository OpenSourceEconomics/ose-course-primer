OSE Computing Primer
====================

by [Gregor Boehl](https://gregorboehl.com).

This course is a generic introduction to (scientific) programming in economics, covering the essentials: 

    * variables
    * loops
    * conditionals
    * functions
    * basics of data analysis
    * plotting
    * perspectives (performance, parallelization, ...)
    * ...

The examples cover Python code, a cheat sheet for R code will be provided.

We will conduct all course communications using [Zulip](https://zulip.com/), so please be sure to join us there. Simply clicking the button below will take you to the proper channels. There I also post the link to the online lectures using [ZOOM](https://zoom.us/).
