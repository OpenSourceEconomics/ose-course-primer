Instead of talking about gates or 0 and 1, in Boolean logic we talk about <code>True</code> and <code>False</code>. Either something is true, or it's false.

    "* **Be specific.** If you can do the same thing two different ways, state which one you used. \"I selected Load\" might mean \"I clicked on Load\" or \"I pressed Alt-L\". Say which you did. Sometimes it matters.\n",
    "* **Be complete.** Tell everything you did. \"I wanted X. You told me to do Y, but X still does not work.\" (...but actually, Y did not work)\n",
    "* **Provide context.** Report the background, such as e.g. the operating system. If you try to do something on Windows 98 and you don't have admin rights, that is definitely an important background.\n",
    "* **Be verbose.** Give more information rather than less. If you say too much, the programmer can ignore some of it. If you say too little, they have to come back and ask more questions. One bug report I received was a single sentence; every time I asked for more information, the reporter would reply with another single sentence. It took me several weeks to get a useful amount of information, because it turned up one short sentence at a time.\n",
    "* **Be careful of pronouns.** Don't use words like \"it\", or references like \"the window\", when it's unclear what they mean. Consider this: \"I started FooApp. It put up a warning window. I tried to close it and it crashed.\" It isn't clear what the user tried to close. Did they try to close the warning window, or the whole of FooApp? It makes a difference. Instead, you could say \"I started FooApp, which put up a warning window. I tried to close the warning window, and FooApp crashed.\" This is longer and more repetitive, but also clearer and less easy to misunderstand.\n",
